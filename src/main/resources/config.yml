# And then there are some keys unique to the type:

# ==== PartialMatch ====
#   - "contain_mode"
#     - Describes where the match might occur
#       - "CONTAINS"
#         - Somewhere in the text
#       - "STARTS_WITH"
#         - At the start
#       - "ENDS_WITH"
#         - At the end
#   - "more_patterns"
#     - Any other keywords that need to appear. Will be ignored if the mode is not "CONTAINS"
#     - A string list, like "levels"

# ==== RegEx ====
#    - "partial_match"
#      - Describes whether it must match the pattern or the pattern must only be contained in it
#        - true
#          - Enables it
#        - false
#          - Disables it
